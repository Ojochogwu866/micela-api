## Challenges

Had a bit of challenge working of this, some of which I feel I did not resolve. But in all, was a good run. Was so much of brainstorming involved with integrating with the API, and a couple of other stuufs I feel wasn't clear enough. I hope every time i gave this would be worth it :)
